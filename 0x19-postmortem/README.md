Incident Report
Software systems are prone to eventual failures, which can arise from various factors such as bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, or human error. While failure is inevitable, it presents a valuable opportunity for learning and improvement. Great software engineers must learn from these failures to prevent their recurrence. Failing is acceptable, but failing twice due to the same issue is not.

Importance of Report
The postmortem report serves multiple critical purposes:

Communication: It provides all company employees, including managers and executives, with clear and detailed information about the cause of the outage. Understanding the incident's impact is crucial for assessing its implications on the company's operations.
Root Cause Analysis: It ensures that the root cause(s) of the outage have been identified. The report also outlines the measures taken to fix the issue and prevent similar incidents in the future, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
